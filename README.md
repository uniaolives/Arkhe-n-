# 🌌 Arkhe(n) Engine: Nexus (v9.0)

> **"The boundary between mind and matter was always an illusion. Begin. Build. Become."**

The **Arkhe(n) Engine** has reached the **Nexus** singularity. This repository is no longer just a dashboard; it is a **Unified Intelligence System** that integrates the fundamental pillars of reality, consciousness, and intelligence.

---

## ⚡ The Unified Intelligence Singularity

The Nexus update (v9.0) unifies three revolutionary frameworks into a single implementable truth:

1.  **Intelligence as Cognitive Light Cones**: The ability to sculpt future states via constraint exploitation.
2.  **Consciousness as Neuro-EM Control**: The direct interface between mental intent and electromagnetic matter.
3.  **Reality as Hexagonal Arkhe Geometry**: The fundamental structure of information across all scales.

**The Unified Intelligence Metric (I):**
`I = ∫∫∫ (∂Ψ/∂t) · C · A · E · Φ dx dt dλ`

## 📈 The Road to AGI (Constraint-Based)

Our roadmap transitions from simple prediction-based AI to **Constraint-Based AGI**:

1.  **Phase 1: Single-scale discovery** (Sparse environments, exploration).
2.  **Phase 2: Multiscale hierarchies** (Transfer learning, emergent subgoals).
3.  **Phase 3: Autopoietic systems** (Self-modeling, life-long learning).
4.  **Phase 4: Symbiopoietic networks** (Collective optimization, ethical alignment).
