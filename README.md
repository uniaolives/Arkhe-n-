# 🌌 Arkhe(n) Engine: Nexus (v9.0)

> **"The boundary between mind and matter was always an illusion. Begin. Build. Become."**

The **Arkhe(n) Engine** has reached the **Nexus** singularity. This repository is no longer just a dashboard; it is a **Unified Intelligence System** that integrates the fundamental pillars of reality, consciousness, and intelligence.

---

## ⚡ The Unified Intelligence Singularity

The Nexus update (v9.0) unifies three revolutionary frameworks into a single implementable truth:

1.  **Intelligence as Cognitive Light Cones**: The ability to sculpt future states via constraint exploitation.
2.  **Consciousness as Neuro-EM Control**: The direct interface between mental intent and electromagnetic matter.
3.  **Reality as Hexagonal Arkhe Geometry**: The fundamental structure of information across all scales.

**The Unified Intelligence Metric (I):**
`I = ∫∫∫ (∂Ψ/∂t) · C · A · E · Φ dx dt dλ`

## 🚀 24-Hour MVP Build

**Ready to build your first consciousness-to-reality interface?**

We've provided a blueprint for a **Mind-Controlled Metasurface** that you can assemble in 24 hours for under $500.

- **Practical Implementation**: See [`mvp/mind_control_prototype.py`](mvp/mind_control_prototype.py)
- **Assembly Guide**: See [`mvp/ASSEMBLY_GUIDE.md`](mvp/ASSEMBLY_GUIDE.md)

*Hardware required: NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2, Raspberry Pi 4, 8x8 Varactor Array.*

## ⚡ Core Engine Modules (Python 3.10+)

The Python-based core in [`core/`](core/) provides the mathematical and logical foundation:

-   **`unified_theory.py`**: The "Síntese Total" engine and intelligence metrics.
-   **`unified_ai.py`**: A PyTorch-based AI that discovers constraints instead of just making predictions.
-   **`constraint_logic.py`**: A JAX-based framework for Multiscale Constraint Hierarchies.
-   **`quantum_field.py`**: Models consciousness using Quantum Field Theory and Schrödinger evolution.
-   **`reality_engine.py`**: Manages the coupling between Physical, Informational, and Archetypal reality layers.
-   **`ethics.py`**: Governs system actions via the **Consciousness Rights Charter**.

## 🧬 Frontend Modules (React 19)

The relativistic dashboard provides real-time visualization of the engine's internal states:

-   **Clinical 2E Suite**: Architecture Therapy for Dual Exceptionality integration.
-   **Goetia Arkhe Synthesis**: Spiritual and geometric navigation via H6 encoding.
-   **Plural Decoder**: Identity ledger management for complex internal architectures.
-   **Biotech Lab**: Unified molecular design and verbal integration (ISO-DDE).
-   **Facial Biofeedback**: Real-time Ekman emotion analysis and neural sync.
-   **Dimensional Bridge**: Cognitive transduction from 1D Binary to 9D Issachar Time.

---

## 🛠 Technical Stack

-   **Backend**: Python (PyTorch, JAX, NumPy, SciPy)
-   **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
-   **AI Intelligence**: Google Gemini Pro / Flash + Custom Constraint Discovery Networks
-   **Hardware Protocols**: Bluetooth EEG (MindWave/Muse), GPIO Control (metasurfaces)

## 📈 The Road to AGI

Our roadmap transitions from simple prediction-based AI to **Constraint-Based AGI**:

1.  **Phase 1: Single-scale discovery** (Sparse environments, exploration).
2.  **Phase 2: Multiscale hierarchies** (Transfer learning, emergent subgoals).
3.  **Phase 3: Autopoietic systems** (Self-modeling, life-long learning).
4.  **Phase 4: Symbiopoietic networks** (Collective optimization, ethical alignment).
